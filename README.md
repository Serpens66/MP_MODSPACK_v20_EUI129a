# MP_MODSPACK_v20_EUI129a_beta7

This is a Multiplayer modpack for Civilization 5.  
The game does not support mods in multiplayer, therefore many mods are written incompatible and packing them into such a modpack is mandatory to be able to load them without the ingame mod manager for multiplayer. I only wrote roughly ~10% of the included mods myself, fixed/adjusted some for multiplayer and the rest is just copy pasted, which is needed for such a modpack.  
You can read about the history and content of the modpack here: https://forums.civfanatics.com/threads/serps-multiplayer-modpack-improved-gameplay.548674/

## DLL used:
https://github.com/Serpens66/DLL-VMC-master_Serp  
(based on whowards DLL v94: http://www.picknmixmods.com/mods/CivV/DLL/Various%20Mod%20Components.html I added various fixed, especially for multiplayer and also added few new features, partly my own work, partly from Community Patch (https://github.com/LoneGazebo/Community-Patch-DLL) and partly from Artifical Unintelligence (https://github.com/DelnarErsike/Civ5-Artificial-Unintelligence-DLL))

## How tu use:
Click on the green "Code" button on the top right and hit "download zip" to download the complete modpack.  
Move the folder MP_MODSPACK_v20_EUI129a to your game installation DLC folder, sth like this: ...Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC  
Now it should be activated already ingame. To uninstall remove that folder from the games directory again.

## WIP !
This is a work in progress version. As you can read in my civfanatics link, I kind of gave up finding the cause for a random game freeze that sometimes happen in multiplayer, especially with 3 or more humans.  
It might be that this freeze is still there and I have no clue what is causing it or how to fix, most liklely from the DLL.
For MP clients it also happened that the happiness fluctuates between the turns quite heavy, causing revolution barbarians to attack, although you have positive happiness... I don't know why.
Also may have other minor bugs.
