			<Text>A Biosphere is a manmade closed ecological system specializing in bioloigcal and ecological scientific research. One of its main characteristics is that it does not rely on matter exchange with any part outside the system. In closed ecological systems, waste products produced by one species must be used by at least one other species. In order to maintain human or animal life, waste products such as carbon dioxide, feces and urine must eventually be converted into oxygen, food and water. All closed ecological systems must contain at least one autotrophic organism. While both chemotrophic and phototrophic organisms are plausible, almost all closed ecological systems to date are based on a phototroph such as green algae. Research conducted at the Biosphere may one day lead to breakthroughs in the creation of life support systems necessary for space colonization.</Text>
