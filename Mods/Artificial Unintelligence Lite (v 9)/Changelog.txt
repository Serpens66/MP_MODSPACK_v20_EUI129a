  * Reduced weight of Culture flavor on Culture GS during rerolls to 10 (from 12, vanilla is 10)
  * Lowered randomness factor to 12 (from 25, vanilla is 50) and "sticky" factor to 50 (from 100, vanilla is 50) for GS rerolls ("sticky" factor is how big of a bonus the current GS gets during rerolls)

  * Updated war evaluation values to make the AI both more cautious, more pragmatic, and more suspicious.
  * Adjusted religion spread parameters to make the AI a bit less missionary-crazed
  * Adjusted AI ideology preference parameters so that the AI is more pragmatic with them and that diplomatic relations affect ideology choice (not just the other way around)
  * Drastically lowered city specialization reroll parameter because it partially makes up for finite-state drawbacks
  * Modified Damage City and Low Priority Attrition tactical move priorities to make them possibly exchangeable with heal (since randomness gives +-3 relative priority)
  * XML Code fully commented

v2 - 2014-09-17:
  * Changelog created
  * XML code commented
  * Typos that caused certain changes to not activate have been fixed

v1 - 2014-09-07:
